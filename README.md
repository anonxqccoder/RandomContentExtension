To xQc, if you actually want to pay me for it, which would be dope but not required, dm me on twitter: https://twitter.com/877445643216df

If there's something you would like to change about it, you can dm me for that as well :), or have one of the Juicer's make a github issue (someone in chat will know)

    * For optimal usage, it is best to pin the extension
    * Click the extension logo
        * ***NEW: THERE IS NOW A "RANDOM CONTENT" BUTTON WHEN YOU RIGHT CLICK ANYWHERE ON A WEBPAGE FOR QUICKER USE*** credits to u/PVC_Fan for the idea
        * **The "CONTENT" button will open a random link from your submitted links**
        * **The upload links button that says "Choose File" will let you submit links**
            * Make a text file, the name doesn't matter
            * Separate links line by line, you can see the example.txt file on the github page if you're confused
            * Click "Choose File" and upload the file like normally, the links will upload to the extension automatically
        * **The "NUKE ALL LINKS (IRREVERISBLE)" button will remove all of your submitted links from the extension, you cannot go back once you confirm the nuke**
        * **Under "Current links:" will be your links**
            * There is the link itself
            * A checkbox to the right of the link, if you wish to disable the link without removing it
            * A remove button, if you wish to remove the link
